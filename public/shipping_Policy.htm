	 Order Processing Duration
Once an order is placed, how long does it take to get shipped? Order processing times differ from industry to industry. Custom-made orders will take longer processing times than items that are ready to ship. If for any reason your order processing durations change, during peak seasons, sales, etc., be sure to update that on your website, product, and checkout pages.

In the image below, see how "Papa Don't Preach" has clearly mentioned their order processing times in their shipping policy:

3.2) Delivery Time
 

Delivery time is the actual time an order takes to reach the customer once it’s been shipped. Delivery times can vary depending on the kind of carriers and delivery services you offer. List out the carriers you integrate with, the mail classes you ship with (Standard, Express, Freight, etc.), and the time it takes.

The image below shows how the global toy retailer, Hamleys, does a brilliant job of including both the delivery times and shipping charges in their shipping policy:

 

delivery-service-charge

 

3.3) Shipping Costs
 

Tell your customers whether you offer free shipping, variable, or flat-rate shipping right in your shipping policy. With this information, customers can gauge the overall cost they will be paying for an item and make a better purchase decision. It also reduces logistics costs and cart abandonment.

Here's an image of "Nike" stating delivery charges and shipping options for orders of varied mail classes:

3.4) International Shipping
 

List out all the destinations you deliver to internationally. Also mention how customs clearance and duties will be handled. If you have any special shipping instructions for international shipping (special packaging, shipping surcharges, etc.), the shipping policy is the right place to include all of that.

In the image below you can see "Aachho" has a dedicated section listing out everything customers might want to know about international shipping, including carriers, customs clearance, and returns/exchanges:

 

international-shipping

 

3.5) Shipping Limitations
 

If you do not service certain locations, ship on holidays or Sundays, have weight limitations, etc., add that to the shipping restrictions section of your shipping policy.

Here's an image of "FedEx" clearly laying out the ground rules of shipping prohibited or restricted items:

 

shipping-imitations

 

3.6) Possible Interruptions And Delays
 

Covid-19 and the resulting lockdowns proved how so many things are out of our hands. The same goes for shipping. It’s a fact of ecommerce that sometimes orders get delayed and nobody is at fault. To contain customer grievances in such situations, it’s best to communicate in advance how you will be handling delays.

This image shows how "H&M" does a fantastic job of intimating customers about possible delays right on their shipping policy page:
